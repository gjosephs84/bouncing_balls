# PROJECT NAME
Bouncing Balls

# DESCRIPTION
A simple animation of two balls bouncing off the edges of the screen

# ROADMAP
Original version set the balls to bounce within a statically descriped area. 

The current interation uses window.innerWidth and window.innerHeight to set the boundaries on initial page load and refresh.

In future iterations I would like to develop one function to move both balls, as well as experiment with changing their colors over time.
